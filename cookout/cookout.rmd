# Cookout Data

## Packages 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(ExPanDaR) # allows for easy permutations
```

## load the data
```{r warning=FALSE}
cookout <- read.csv("cookout.csv")  # read csv file
cookout %>% as.tibble() # convert to tibble
```

## use expand() to find permutations
```{r}
# all unique combinations of names, food types and flavor strengths
# nesting() outputs only combinations that already appear in the data
flavor<- cookout %>% expand(nesting(Name, Food.Type, Flavor.Strength))
flavor
```
## hamburgers
```{r}
# list of names who have 2 flavor strength preferences for hamburgers
hamburger_names <- flavor %>% filter(Food.Type == "hamburger") %>%
  count(Name, sort=TRUE) %>%
  filter(n==2) %>%
  count(Name) %>%
  select(Name)
hamburger_names
```

## Ice Cream

```{r}
# list of names who have 2 flavor strength preferences for ice cream
ice_cream_names <- flavor %>% filter(Food.Type == "ice cream") %>%
  count(Name, sort=TRUE) %>%
  filter(n==2) %>%
  count(Name) %>%
  select(Name)
ice_cream_names
```


```{r}
#Filter the list to ice cream names with two flavor strength preferences
hamburger_toppings <- cookout %>% filter(Food.Type == "hamburger") %>%
  filter(Name %in% ice_cream_names$Name)
hamburger_toppings
```
```{r}
# Currently working on... how to find permutations of toppings across flavor strengths, by name. 
# Desired output: George: onions, mayo | onions, tomato
# Need to review expand() documentation
# or write a script?
hamburger_toppings %>% 
  filter(Food.Type=="hamburger") %>%
  expand(nesting(Name,Flavor.Strength, Toppings))
```
